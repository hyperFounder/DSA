- A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, and storing data in a computer.
- It defines the relationship between the data elements and the operations that can be performed on them.
- Data structures are fundamental to designing efficient algorithms and are used to store, manage, and manipulate data in various ways depending on the requirements of the application.

### Resources for Induction 

- Induction is an inference rule used in formal proofs, and is the foundation of most correctness proofs for computer programs
- Weak induction a.k.a "normal induction" [https://www.math.umd.edu/~immortal/CMSC250/notes/weakandstrong.pdf](https://www.math.umd.edu/~immortal/CMSC250/notes/weakandstrong.pdf). Assume true for n = k, and prove true for n = k + 1. Remember about the ladder analogy
- Strong induction ak.a course of values induction [https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs173/sp2009/lectures/lect_18.pdf](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs173/sp2009/lectures/lect_18.pdf)


### Notes on Trees and Graph based DSA

- Trees, Forests, Spanning trees, DFS, BFS, etc.
- Minimum spanning trees, Prim's Algorithm and Kruskal's Algorithm for finding MSTs
