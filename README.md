- A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, and storing data in a computer.
- It defines the relationship between the data elements and the operations that can be performed on them.
- Data structures are fundamental to designing efficient algorithms and are used to store, manage, and manipulate data in various ways depending on the requirements of the application.

### Notes on Trees and Graph based DSA

- Trees, Forests, Spanning trees, DFS, BFS, etc.
- Minimum spanning trees, Prim's Algorithm and Kruskal's Algorithm for finding MSTs
